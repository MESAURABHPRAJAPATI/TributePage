                <strong>December 1988-</strong> Sachin Tendulkar made his
                first-class debut for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy at the age of
                just 15. He scored his 1st first-class century in his debut game
                making him the youngest Indian to score a century on his
                first-class debut.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>November 1989-</strong> After a dream debut season for
                Mumbai and a century on Irani Trophy debut, Sachin made his Test
                debut for India against Pakistan at Karachi.

              <li>
                <strong>December 1989--</strong>
                Following decent performances in the Test series, Sachin was
                subsequently picked for the ODI leg of the Pakistan tour and
                made his debut in the 2nd ODI registering his first duck in
                international cricket.

                <strong>August 1990--</strong>
                Sachin Tendulkar helped India save the Old Trafford Test through
                his maiden century in international cricket. Aged 17 years and
                107 days, Sachin was the youngest ever Test centurion in the
                history of Indian cricket.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>November 1993--</strong>
                Sachin bowled India to a win over South Africa in the
                semi-finals of the Hero Cup. Defending just 6 runs in the last
                over, Sachin gave away just 3 runs to pave the way for a
                memorable win.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>March 1994--</strong>
                Sachin opened for the first time in ODI cricket and immediately
                made an impact scoring a 49-ball 82 against New Zealand.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>September 1994--</strong>
                After making the opening spot his own, Sachin
                scored his first ODI hundred in his 79th game. He made 110
                against Australia.

                <strong>May 1995--</strong>
                Aged 22, Sachin tied the knot with Anjali Mehta. He hails his
                partnership with Anjali the best partnership of his life.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>February 1996--</strong>
                Playing in his second World Cup, Tendulkar announced himself on
                the big stage as he finished the tournament with 523 runs, which
                was then the record for most runs in an edition of World Cup.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>October 1996--</strong>
                Tendulkar captained India for the first time. Though he started
                with a win against Australia in his first Test as captain,
                Sachin did not do well as captain overall.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>April 1998--</strong>
                Tendulkar played his best cricket in the Coca-Cola Cup against
                New Zealand and Australia. He single-handedly helped India
                clinch the triangular series scoring 143 and 134 in the virtual
                semi-final and finals against Australia.

                <strong>May 1999--</strong>
                By his own admission, the toughest times of his career, Sachin
                left India‚Äôs World Cup campaign to perform the last rites of his
                father who had passed away in Mumbai. He showed great resilience
                in coming back to England and scored an unbeaten 140 in the next
                game he played.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>February 2000--</strong>
                After two unsuccessful stints as captain, Sachin gave up
                captaincy and never took it back. He recommended Sourav Ganguly
                for the role and what construed after that is history.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>March 2001--</strong>
                The little master became the first ever cricketer to have
                registered 10,000 ODI runs. He achieved this feat during the
                knock of 139 against Australia at Indore.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>March 2003--</strong>
                Tendulkar lit India‚Äôs World Cup campaign in 2003, scoring a
                total of 673 runs in the tournament beating his own record set 7
                years ago. Sachin‚Äôs contributions were critical in India‚Äôs road
                to the finals where they were defeated by Australia.

                <strong>January 2004--</strong>
                Sachin recorded his first double hundred in Australia. Batting
                at his favorite cricket ground Sydney, Sachin remained unbeaten
                on 241. The remarkable aspect of this innings was he did not
                play a single cover drive in his innings which lasted for 436
                balls.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>March 2005--</strong>
                Scoring twin fifties in India‚Äôs win against Pakistan at the Eden
                Gardens, Tendulkar also went past 10,000 Test runs and became
                only the fifth player to do so in the history of the game.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>December 2005--</strong>
                Tendulkar went past Gavaskar‚Äôs record (34 hundreds) of the most
                centuries in Test cricket as the little master scored 109
                against Sri Lanka in Delhi.

                <strong>January 2008--</strong>
                In the New Year Sydney Test of 2008, Sachin was at the cynosure
                of the ‚ÄòMonkey-Gate‚Äô controversy. Since he was batting with
                Harbhajan Singh when the incident happened, Sachin was firm in
                his stance that Harbhajan never racially abused Symonds and even
                threatened to boycott the tour. Common sense prevailed and the
                three-match ban sanctioned on Harbhajan was lifted.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>February 2010--</strong>

                Sachin breached the 200-run mark in ODI‚Äôs as he became the first
                ever player to score a double-century in ODI cricket. He
                remained unbeaten on 200 off 147 balls against South Africa at
                Gwalior.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>December 2010--</strong>
                Sachin scored a memorable hundred against South Africa at
                Centurion, which was his 50th Test century.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>April 2011--</strong>
                Sachin became a World Cup winner as India defeated Sri Lanka in
                the finals of the ICC World Cup 2011. Tendulkar topped the
                Indian batting charts scoring 482 runs in the tournament with 2
                centuries.

                The Mumbaikar finally scored a century to complete
                100 international centuries. His knock of 114 against Bangladesh
                at Mirpur was his 49th ODI hundred and his last century in
                international cricket.

              <li>
                <strong>December 2012--</strong>
                With 18,426 runs to his name to go with 49 ODI hundreds, Sachin
                called time on his ODI career. He finished the game as the
                greatest to have played the ODI format.

                After much speculation about his playing career, Sachin
                announced his retirement from international cricket. He played
                his final Test, which was his 200th of his career; against West
                Indies at home ground Wankhede.
